# Migrator

A low-level, slightly idiosyncratic PostgreSQL migration tool written in Haskell for my personal use.

## Installation

```sh
stack build && stack install
```

This installs an executable called `migrate`.

## Usage

For usage, execute `migrate --help`. For usage on any individual command, `migrate --help COMMAND`, e.g., `migrate --help up`.
